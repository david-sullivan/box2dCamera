# box2dCamera
an attempt to have ofxBox2d objects collide with ofxOpenCV blobs in openframeworks v0.10.1

Based on the many examples in Vanderlin's Openframeworks addon ofxBox2d
https://github.com/vanderlin/ofxBox2d

mashed up with the opencv example in openframeworks
https://openframeworks.cc/

All of the examples for using ofxBox2d with ofxOpenCv on the web were older than the new glm syntax,
and no longer worked.

I'm not a c++ programmer, so i am sure there is a lot in the code that could be changed or optimized.
If you have any suggestions, please let me know.

I have tried using similar code with video, and it always quits after a few minutes. I would love to figure that out.
